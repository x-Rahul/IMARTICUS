    "# Bernoulli Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution for a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability $ p $ and the value 0 with probability $ 1 - p $. It is named after the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli. This distribution is used to model a single trial of a process that can result in one of two outcomes, often referred to as \"success\" and \"failure.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics of the Bernoulli Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Support:** The random variable $ X $ can take values in $ \\{0, 1\\} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Probability Mass Function (PMF):**\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P(X = x) = \\begin{cases} \n",
    "   p & \\text{if } x = 1 \\\\\n",
    "   1 - p & \\text{if } x = 0 \n",
    "   \\end{cases}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   where $ 0 \\leq p \\leq 1 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mean (Expected Value):**\n",

    "   E[X] = p\n",
    "   $$\n",

    "4. **Variance:**\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{Var}(X) = p(1 - p)\n",

    "   \\frac{1 - 6p(1 - p)}{p(1 - p)}\n",

    "### Applications:\n",
    "- **Modeling binary outcomes:** Used to model any experiment that has exactly two possible outcomes, such as flipping a coin (heads/tails), success/failure in a trial, yes/no responses, etc.\n",
    "- **Building blocks for other distributions:** Serves as the foundation for the Binomial distribution, which is the distribution of the sum of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where you flip a fair coin. The probability of getting heads (success) is $ p = 0.5 $, and the probability of getting tails (failure) is $ 1 - p = 0.5 $.\n",

    "   0.5 & \\text{if } x = 1 \\text{ (heads)} \\\\\n",
