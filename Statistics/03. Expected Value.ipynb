    "### Expected Value $ E(X) $\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected value is the probability-weighted sum of all possible values that the random variable can take. The expected value, denoted as $ E(X) $, of a random variable $ X $ is a measure of the central tendency of the possible values that $ X $ can take. It is essentially the long-run average value of $ X $ over numerous repetitions of the experiment or process that generates $ X $. The expected value is often referred to as the mean of the random variable.\n",

    "For a discrete random variable $ X $ with possible values $ x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n $ and corresponding probabilities $ P(X = x_i) $, the expected value is calculated as:\n",
