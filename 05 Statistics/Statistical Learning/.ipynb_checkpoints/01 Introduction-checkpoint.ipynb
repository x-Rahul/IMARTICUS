    "- **1940s**: Development of logistic regression as an alternative to linear discriminant analysis.\n",
    "- **Early 1970s**: The term generalized linear model was introduced, encompassing both linear and logistic regression.\n",
    "- **Late 1970s**: Many more linear methods for data learning became available, although non-linear methods were computationally difficult.\n",
    "- **1980s**: Advances in computing technology allowed the use of non-linear methods. Development of classification and regression trees, generalized additive models, and the rise of neural networks.\n",
    "- **1990s**: Emergence of support vector machines.\n",
    "- **Recent Years**: Statistical learning has evolved into a prominent subfield with a focus on supervised and unsupervised modeling and prediction, driven by the availability of powerful and user-friendly software like Python."
