    "### Binomial Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the number of successes $ k $ in a fixed number $ n $ of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has two possible outcomes (success or failure) with a constant probability of success $ p $.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics of the Binomial Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parameters**:\n",
    "   - $ n $: The number of independent trials.\n",
    "   - $ p $: The probability of success on each trial.\n",
    "   - $ q = 1 - p $: The probability of failure on each trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**:\n",
    "   For a random variable $ X $ following a Binomial distribution with parameters $ n $ and $ p $, the PMF is:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k q^{n-k}, \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   where $ \\binom{n}{k} $ is the binomial coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mean and Variance**:\n",
    "   The mean and variance of a Binomial distributed random variable $ X $ are:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   E(X) = n \\cdot p\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{Var}(X) = n \\cdot p \\cdot q\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Business**: Sales success rates, customer conversion rates.\n",
    "- **Science**: Biological experiments, quality control.\n",
    "- **Engineering**: Reliability testing, failure analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "If you flip a fair coin 10 times (where $ n = 10 $) and want to find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads (where $ k = 3 $), you can use the Binomial distribution with $ p = 0.5 $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X = 3) = \\binom{10}{3} (0.5)^3 (0.5)^7 = \\binom{10}{3} (0.5)^{10}\n",

    "### Binomial Distribution Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Suppose a factory produces light bulbs, and each light bulb has a 5% chance of being defective. If we select 100 light bulbs at random, the number of defective bulbs follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n = 100$ (number of trials) and $p = 0.05$ (probability of success, in this case, a bulb being defective).\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability mass function (PMF) of a binomial distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $n$ is the number of trials (100 in this example).\n",
    "- $k$ is the number of successes (number of defective bulbs).\n",
    "- $p$ is the probability of success (0.05 in this example).\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ of a binomial distribution are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mu = np $$\n",
    "$$ \\sigma = \\sqrt{np(1-p)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculations:\n",
    "- Mean: $\\mu = np = 100 \\times 0.05 = 5$\n",
    "- Standard deviation: $\\sigma = \\sqrt{np(1-p)} = \\sqrt{100 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.95} \\approx 2.18$\n",

    "### Plotting the Binomial Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot below shows the binomial distribution for $n = 100$ and $p = 0.05$. \n",
    "\n",
    "From our calculations:\n",
    "- The mean $\\mu$ is 5.\n",
    "- The standard deviation $\\sigma$ is approximately 2.18.\n",
