    "- **Mutually Exclusive Events**: Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot happen at the same time. For example, when rolling a die, the events of rolling a 2 and rolling a 4 are mutually exclusive.\n",
    "- **Non-Mutually Exclusive Events**: Two events are non-mutually exclusive if they can happen at the same time. For example, drawing a card from a deck that is both red and a face card.\n",
    "- **Independent Events**: Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other. For example, flipping a coin and rolling a die.\n",
    "- **Dependent Events**: Two events are dependent if the occurrence of one affects the occurrence of the other. For example, drawing two cards from a deck without replacement.\n"
