    "## Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. If $A$ and $B$ are two events, the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Let event $A$ be drawing a red card, and event $B$ be drawing a heart. We want to find the probability of drawing a red card given that we have drawn a heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The probability of drawing a heart (event $B$) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(B) = \\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The probability of drawing a red card (event $A$) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A) = \\frac{26}{52} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The probability of drawing a red card and a heart (both $A$ and $B$ occurring) is the probability of drawing a heart, since all hearts are red:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A \\cap B) = P(B) = \\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using the conditional probability formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability of drawing a red card given that we have drawn a heart is 1 (or 100%), because all hearts are red.\n"
