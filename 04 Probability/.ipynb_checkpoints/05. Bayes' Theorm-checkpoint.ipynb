    "## Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. It allows us to update the probability of an event based on new evidence. For two events $A$ and $B$, Bayes' theorem is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $P(A|B)$ is the probability of event $A$ given that event $B$ has occurred.\n",
    "- $P(B|A)$ is the probability of event $B$ given that event $A$ has occurred.\n",
    "- $P(A)$ is the prior probability of event $A$.\n",
    "- $P(B)$ is the prior probability of event $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is based on the concept of conditional probability and is derived from the definition of conditional probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging this formula, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A \\cap B) = P(B|A) \\cdot P(A) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting into the conditional probability formula gives us Bayes' theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This theorem is particularly useful in cases where we want to reverse the conditioning: updating our belief about $A$ based on the occurrence of $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a disease affects 1% of the population, and a test is 99% accurate in detecting it. If a person tests positive, the probability of having the disease is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prior Probabilities:**\n",
    "   - $P(\\text{Disease}) = 0.01$\n",
    "   - $P(\\text{No Disease}) = 0.99$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conditional Probabilities:**\n",
    "   - $P(\\text{Positive Test | Disease}) = 0.99$\n",
    "   - $P(\\text{Positive Test | No Disease}) = 0.05$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Probability of Testing Positive:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$ P(\\text{Positive Test}) = P(\\text{Positive Test | Disease}) \\cdot P(\\text{Disease}) + P(\\text{Positive Test | No Disease}) \\cdot P(\\text{No Disease}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$ P(\\text{Positive Test}) = (0.99 \\cdot 0.01) + (0.05 \\cdot 0.99) = 0.0594 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$ P(\\text{Disease | Positive Test}) = \\frac{0.99 \\cdot 0.01}{0.0594} \\approx 0.167 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the probability of having the disease given a positive test is approximately 16.7%.\n"
